##### Hypervisor level network filtering for VM

This will prevent various spoofing from the guest (eg: MAC, ARP), see  https://libvirt.org/firewall.html for more

On the host issue `sudo virsh edit --domain $DOMAIN`

Find the `<interface>` stanza and add:

```
<interface type='bridge'>
  <SNIP>
  <filterref filter='clean-traffic'/>
</interface>
```
