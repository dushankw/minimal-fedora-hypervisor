https://www.berrange.com/posts/2012/01/17/building-application-sandboxes-with-libvirt-lxc-kvm/ (the developer acknowledges the total lack of SELinux support)

### Installing and basic use

```
sudo dnf install libvirt-sandbox
virt-sandbox -c qemu:///session /usr/bin/bash
```

### SELinux

Invocation resulted in an issue reading the file `/etc/libvirt-sandbox/scratch/mounts.cfg` and my suspicion was that SELinux was to blame...

Doing a `setenforce 0` proved this hypothesis, so let's fix it!

With SELinux in permissive mode (I hope you are doing this on a devbox!) take note of the current time:

```
$ date
Wed Jun  3 16:58:27 AEST 2020
```

Invoke the sandbox again (successfully), then exit from it and generate a policy from all the captured violations:

```
ausearch -m AVC,USER_AVC -ts 'HH:MM:SS' | audit2why
ausearch -m AVC,USER_AVC -ts 'HH:MM:SS' | audit2allow -M virt_sandbox_dkw
```

Review `virt_sandbox_dkw.te` to make sure it is sane, then install it with `semodule -i virt_sandbox_dkw.pp`

Set SELinux back to enforcing `setenforce 1`

Take note of the time again, re-invoke the sandbox and exit, then review the SELinux log `ausearch -m AVC,USER_AVC -ts 'HH:MM:SS'`

Hopefully there are no more violations, should you find more (such as when you sandbox a different application), the same method can be applied to address them

**NOTE: This is a WIP and I have not properly reviewed the resulting policy, I feel it may be too permissive and I am not personally using this tool yet!**

### To Do

Get graphical applications to work

### Warnings

This tool does not seem to be under very active development
